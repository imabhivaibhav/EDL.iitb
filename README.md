## Introduction

A High Sensitivity Optical Detection System for Spectrometry refers to a sophisticated setup used in scientific instrumentation for analyzing light. Spectrometry involves the measurement and analysis of the properties of light, such as its intensity, wavelength, and polarization. We deigned a portable spectrometer to measure the spectrum of a sample and analyze the absorption and transmission of different wavelengths.

## Objective

The objective of the High Sensitivity Optical Detection System for Spectrometry is to provide precise and reliable analysis of light signals, enabling accurate measurements of various optical properties such as intensity, wavelength, and polarization. This system aims to enhance sensitivity, resolution, and data accuracy for applications in analytical chemistry, environmental monitoring, biomedical research, and other scientific fields.
